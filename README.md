# Cloud9 Workspace Hibernation Preventer
### Another proud project by Simon Cheng
How to install:
```
# And of course, run this in the cloud9 workspace
git clone https://github.com/scheng123/stay-active-c9
cd stay-active-c9/
npm install

```
Starting the "Preventer":
```
npm start
## OR ##
node index.js

```
## Important Notes:
You have to have at least node 7.6 and above
You may see another "you" in your workspace (Its the "Preventer")
If you see the error "Page has crashed" or the application exits randomly, probably you set the height and width too big. Use default size in the config or set a smaller size
### Enjoy!
